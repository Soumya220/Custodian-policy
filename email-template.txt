Subject: Reminder: Running EC2 Instances at 6 PM

Hello,

This is a reminder that your EC2 instances are still running in your AWS account, even though it is already 6 PM.

Please ensure that you stop the instances that are not needed during non-working hours to optimize costs and improve resource utilization.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
